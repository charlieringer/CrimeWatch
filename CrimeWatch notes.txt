====Basics====

The app does a check every xx minutes which the user can decide, i.e. they can do battery-saving mode or frequent
Sensible frequencies might be between every fifteen minutes to every hour or simply on demand when the check the app.

The app does the following steps:

Send a GET request to:
https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime?lat=LATITUDE&lng=LONGTITUDE&date=DATE

We then receive back a response from the server in the form of JSON (actually an array of objects). More info: https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crime-street/
Count the number of crimes in the area that are related to crimes against a person such as violent crime, theft and so on.

We can use up to 6 months worth of data to get an accurate picture over time, but this might be a lot for the pebble to handle; 3 months might be easier for the watch to handle and be faster.

If the number is high (tbd, could be per capita or relative to size) then alert the user.

====Parsing the JSON====

Pseudocode:

crime_count = 0
FOREACH json_object IN list of json_objects DO:
  obj = JSON.parse(json_object)
  IF obj.category == violent crime (or other relevant crime) THEN:
    INCREMENT crime_count by 1
  END IF
END FOREACH

RETURN crime_count
